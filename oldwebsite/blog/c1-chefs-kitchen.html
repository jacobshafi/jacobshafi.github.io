      The DBC experience is a unique one to say the least. The fact that there is talk about emotional intelligence is something I am very excited about. I have always been interested in the connection between being in touch with your emotions and the inevitable causality of emotions on your well-being. The fact that there is a discussion on being inspired everyday and looking for ways to grow while hurdling over every challenge is something I am really exicted about as well.

        Right from the start, after applying for Dev Bootcamp, I already had a glimpse of what to expect at Dev Bootcamp and the expectations the instructors will have on the students. I look at Dev Bootcamp as the pioneer of an ideology that is relatively new in the field. The importance of collaboration and the constant strive for growth and perseverance are qualities not found in this industry by any means. Dev Bootcamp establishes an environment that breeds professionalism and motivation while maintaing mindfullness and appreciation, all qualities I find to be perfect for a well-rounded developer.
